# Adventofcode25 - Elixir 🧪

👋 Hello! 2025 was the year I did AoC in something totally different. I have had almost no exposure
to functional languages before. I have also never used Elixir before this year.

So please take my ugly and inefficient code with a grain of salt! I'm trying to learn the language as I solve
the problems for the year.
